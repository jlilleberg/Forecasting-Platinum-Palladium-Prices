# Motivation

Having wanted to learn time-series, I took an online class, read [fpp2](https://otexts.com/fpp2/index.html) and reviewed Facebook's Prophet. I pulled the current prices of Platinum from [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com). Since this project was to improve my ability to forecast as well as the forecasting itself, I applied as many statistical concepts as possible to reinforce the strength hof my forecasts and predictions.
